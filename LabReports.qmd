# Lab Reports {-}

Over the course of the semester, you will complete three lab reports. For each lab report, you will participate in online example experiments of the Psychology of Language outside of class time. You may complete these experiments using computer labs or your own computer. For each assigned experiment, you are expected to read the accompanying article (available on Canvas) to be able to describe the methodology, hypotheses, and outcomes. Be sure to read the article after participating in the experiment!

## Lab Report Format {-}
Your lab report should provide the following pieces of information:

1.	Name of the lab and the date of your participation.
2.	Write a description of what you did during the experiment.
3.	Identify and explain how the independent variable(s) was/were manipulated.
4.	Identify and explain how the dependent variable(s) was/were measured. 
5.	State the experimental hypothesis.
6.	State the outcomes of the experiment.
7.	Describe whether you think your data are consistent with the outcomes of the experiment. Why or why not?
8.	Suggest future directions, such as how the experiment might be modified to improve the investigation or examine effects in other populations. 
9.	Write the APA-formatted citation of the accompanying article. 

Write clearly, concisely, and with complete sentences. You should complete the lab reports on your own. You should submit your lab reports to Canvas via the assignment links on or before the due date/time to receive full credit. 

An example lab report can be found [here](SampleLabReport.pdf).
