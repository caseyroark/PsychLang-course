    "section": "Grades",
    "text": "Grades\nAs mentioned above, grading and assessment of your learning in this course will function differently from what you have probably encountered in your other courses. Importantly, my decisions about how grades and learning assessments will happen in this class is based on the science of learning - that is, what we know about how to actually learn and engage in the material. Because this looks different from most of what you’ve probably experienced before, we will spend substantial time going over what this looks like at the beginning of the semester.\nThe grade you receive in this course is completely up to you. Your final grade will depend on class attendance (which is critical in this course) and completion of specific assessments of learning to a satisfactory standard. The assessments in this course are organized into modules. Achieving certain letter grades requires satisfactory completion of the different modules.\nTo earn an A in this course, all of the following are required:\n\nMaximum of two unexcused absences\n80% or higher on all quizzes\n80% or higher on final exam\nComplete Foundational Module to a satisfactory level\nComplete Basic Module to a satisfactory level\nComplete Module B to a satisfactory level\nComplete Module A to a satisfactory level\n\nTo earn a B in this course, all of the following are required:\n\nMaximum of three unexcused absences\n70% or higher on all quizzes\n70% or higher on final exam\nComplete Foundational Module to a satisfactory level\nComplete Basic Module to a satisfactory level\nComplete Module B to a satisfactory level\n\nTo earn a C in this course, all of the following are required:\n\nMaximum of four unexcused absences\n60% or higher on all quizzes\n60% or higher on final exam\nComplete Foundational Module to a satisfactory level\nComplete Basic Module to a satisfactory level\n\nTo earn a D in this course:\n\nMore than four unexcused absences\n60% or higher on all quizzes\n60% or higher on final exam\nComplete Foundational Module to a satisfactory level\n\nTo earn an F in this course:\n\nMore than four unexcused absences\n&lt;60% or higher on all quizzes\n&lt;60% or higher on final exam\nIncomplete/Unsatisfactory Foundational Module\n\nIf you are using this course to complete the Capstone requirement, you must complete the Capstone Module to a satisfactory standard. The Capstone requirement is inherently pass/fail – you either complete it to satisfactory standards or you do not. As this is independent from the other modules, you may complete the Capstone Module in addition to any other modules to receive your desired grade in the course.\n\nModules:\nFoundational Module (required for A, B, C, and D)\n\nDuring Class 1: “Where are you now?” Note – if you join this course after the first class, you still need to complete this.\nHomeworks 1-5 (must complete to satisfactory level, unlimited no-cost resubmissions)\n\nBasic Module (required for A, B, and C)\n\nHomeworks 6-9 (must complete to satisfactory level, 2 no-cost resubmissions)\nPre-quiz learning assessment – at least 3/5 complete [note: this can be any three of the five options]\nPost-quiz learning assessment – at least 3/5 complete [note: this can be any three of the five options]\nResearch Reports 3/5 complete [note: this can be any three of the five options]\nReading questions 13/20 complete [note: this can be any 13 of the 20 options]\n\nModule B (required for A and B)\n\nHomeworks 10-11 (must complete to satisfactory level, 0 no-cost resubmissions)\nPre-quiz learning assessment – at least 4/5 complete [note: this can be any four of the five options]\nPost-quiz learning assessment – at least 4/5 complete [note: this can be any four of the five options]\nSpecial Topic paper\nResearch Reports 4/5 complete [note: this can be any four of the five options]\nReading questions – 15/20 complete [note: this can be any 15 of the 20 options]\n\nModule A (required for A)\n\nHomeworks 12-13 (must complete to satisfactory level, 0 no-cost resubmissions)\nPre-quiz learning assessment – 5/5 complete\nPost-quiz learning assessment – 5/5 complete\nSpecial Topic presentation\nSpecial Topic paper – additional section\nResearch Reports – 5/5 complete\nReading questions – 18/20 complete [note: this can be any 18 of the 20 options]\n\nCapstone Module (required for taking this course to fulfill capstone requirement)\n\nFill out capstone form and submit to Psychology office\nDecide on an experiment topic and basic design – research question based on replication or extension or prior work\nGorilla Experiment Builder: make account, complete tutorials\nExperimental Design and Analysis Plan – including variables, measures, and specific hypothesis/hypotheses\nGorilla Experiment Builder: build your experiment\nGorilla Experiment Builder: pilot test the entire experiment on yourself\nGorilla Experiment Builder: work with me to run experiment\nAnalyze experiment data to address your research hypothesis/question\nPlot figures of experimental results\nDiscuss whether your results support/refute your hypothesis\nIntegrate your findings with existing literature (Discussion)\nMotivate your research question from existing literature (Introduction)\nSummarize your methods and results in writing (Methods, Results)\nSummarize your entire experiment (question, design, results, discussion) briefly (Abstract)\nPresent results of experiment at Global, Racial, and Social Inequality Lab Symposium: “Memories and Memorials” on April 19, 2024 at Great Bay Community College in Portsmouth, NH. Transportation will be provided.\n\nWhat do ‘satisfactory’ and ‘unsatisfactory’ mean?\nMy goal is for you to reach your desired learning objectives (and to get the grade you hope to achieve in this class). As a result, I need to assess whether you met a learning objective or you did not meet the learning objective. Each assignment must be completed to satisfactory standards to be counted as complete. Unsatisfactory is the same as incomplete. There is no partial credit – an assignment either meets the standards or does not.\nThe requirements for a satisfactory standard will be made clear for each assignment. Examples of both satisfactory and unsatisfactory responses will be given for many assignments. If you ever are unsure of what an assignment demands for satisfactory standard, please reach out to me. Assignments will have the possibility of resubmission (sometimes without a cost, other times with a cost - we will get into that in a sec) so that you can meet the satisfactory standards.\nIt’s also critical for a satisfactory standard that you turn in assignments on time. Late work may be accepted - but it will cost you (see below).\nFlexibility and tokens:\nThere is built-in flexibility across the course. For the Foundational and Basic Modules, you may resubmit the assignments at no cost (unlimited times for Foundational, up to two times for Basic). For resubmissions beyond this, we will use a token system.\nYou will be given four (virtual) tokens at the beginning of the semester.\nYou may earn additional tokens in the following ways:\n\nturn in any Research Report at least 24 hours before the stated deadline (max 5 tokens)\nturn in the Special Topic Paper at least 24 hours before the stated deadline (1 token)\nvisit my office hours (1 token per visit, max 2 tokens)\nattend the class immediately before Spring Break (3/14/24; 1 token)\nattend the last day of class (5/2/24; 1 token)\n\nYou may spend tokens in the following ways:\n\nan additional resubmission attempt on any assignment (i.e., beyond two for Basic Module or any resubmission for A or B level)\nremove an unexcused absence from your total number of absences\nturn in an assignment up to 24 hours late (if you wanted to turn in an assignment 25 hours late, you’d need 2 tokens)\ndrop your lowest quiz score (only once)\nIf you have additional tokens at the end of the semester that you do not want to or cannot use on resubmissions, absences, or late assignments, you may spend two or three tokens to skip a question of your choice on the final exam (two tokens for short answer and drawing type questions, three tokens for essay questions). This can accumulate. If you have, let’s say, four tokens at the end of the semester, you may skip two short answer questions on the final exam. I’ll make sure you know how many tokens you have going into the final exam so you can indicate which questions you’d like to skip if relevant.\nFinally, if you have four tokens left at the end of the semester, I’ll increase your grade from a B, C, or D to a B+, C+, or D+. For example, say you go into the final with six tokens. You spend two tokens to skip two questions that you’d prefer not to answer. You end the course having earned a B. With those four leftover tokens, your grade will be increased to a B+. Note that it might make more sense for you to use tokens to account for absences or to resubmit an assignment. You will not be able to use tokens to get bumped up beyond the letter grade you earned (e.g., if you earned a B, you cannot be bumped up to an A- if you have not completed the requirements for an A). Intermediate minus distinctions will not be given unless under bizarre unforeseen circumstances. If you earned a specific letter grade, you’ve earned the full letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D).\n\nUnexcused versus excused absences:\nAn unexcused absence is any absence that does not have a clear, documented, and reasonable reason for missing class. You may spend one of your tokens to nullify an unexcused absence.\nIf you must miss class for a clear, documented, and reasonable reason (e.g., sickness, medical reason, emergency, etc.), you do not need to spend one of your tokens. You must communicate with me as soon as possible with documentation, if applicable.\nIf you need to miss class for a planned activity, please let me know as far in advance as possible. If you need accommodation for a religious or cultural holiday/observance, you are encouraged to make the request as early in the semester as possible.\n\n\nAssignment Types:\n\nReading Questions\nFor most classes (20/28 classes) there will be an assigned reading. There will be research questions associated with each reading that you should reflect on, answer, and identify concepts you are still struggling with or have questions about.\nThe reading questions are meant to give you additional examples, guidance, or ways to think about the material you are encountering. It is not meant to demonstrate the only parts of the chapter you should read or pay attention to. You may be quizzed or asked about things that are in the reading, but are not addressed in the reading questions. You are responsible for all material in the reading.\n\n\nHomework\nThere are several homework assignments that are due throughout the semester. Some of these are foundational for further progress in the course and are thus a part of the Foundational Module. Some of these are basic aspects that I would expect to be mastered for general C-level passing of this course and are part of the Basic Module. Others are more advanced and get into demonstration of deeper conceptual knowledge on psychology of language and are in Modules A and B.\nEach assignment has its own description, which can be accessed through the course website. Take note of the specific assignments required for the completion of specific modules above.\nMost homework will align with readings and the topics that are being covered in class at that time.\n\n\nQuizzes and learning assessments\nThere will be five quizzes associated with the first part of this course. Quizzes are designed to make sure that you are engaging with and understanding the material and will cover both readings and lectures. Quizzes will be associated with each specific topic and will not be cumulative. Quizzes will be administered in person at the end of each topic and will have multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blanks, true/false, and identification question formats.\nPre-quiz learning assessments. Before each quiz, you will complete a pre-quiz learning assessment. You will rate your confidence about certain topics and identify concepts you still have questions about. We will address these ongoing questions in class on the day before each quiz.\nPost-quiz learning assessments. After each quiz, you will complete a post-quiz learning assessment. For each question you were incorrect, you should reflect on your thinking – why did you make the response that you did? What was incorrect about this response and what is the correct response? How will you change your behavior for the next quiz?\n\n\nFinal Exam\nThere is a cumulative written final exam for this course. This exam will assess your knowledge acquired from topics spanning across the course. The exam grades will not be curved, but please note the relatively flexible scores to demonstrate mastery over the material (e.g., A &gt;= 80% on final exam; B &gt;=70% on final exam; C/D: &gt;= 60% on final exam; F: &lt;60% on final exam) in addition to the other module-based assignments in the course.\nThe final exam will occur in person on a date determined by the university’s schedule – this is not negotiable.\nAs stated above, you may trade in tokens to skip questions on the final, with no limit on the number of tokens (2 tokens, 1 short answer or drawing question; 3 tokens, 1 essay question). Note that you may have a possible maximum of 14 tokens. There will be 10 questions on the final, so you will still need take the final, but this will simplify it greatly if you are able to/choose to save your tokens.\n\n\nResearch Reports\nFive times in the semester, Research Reports will be due. Research Reports require you to read a specific brief research article, answer some basic questions about the experimental design (e.g., dependent/independent variables, measures, hypotheses), summarize the methods and results in your own words, and reflect on the meaning of the research outcomes based on what you’ve learned in the class and your real-world experiences.\n\n\nSpecial Topic Paper\nFor students who wish to demonstrate further mastery over the course materials (and earn an A or B in the course), a Special Topic Paper will be required. This topic will be one of the advanced special topics covered in the second half of the course. This paper will require thinking deeply about how research in this topic area relates to concepts we have discussed in class.\nBasic requirements of a Special Topic Paper:\n\nSelection of special topic (with my approval)\nRead article assigned for special topic\nSubmitted on time – due by the beginning of class on the day of the special topic discussion\nFulfill specific requirements of special topic paper (defined specifically in that assignment)\n\n“A” requirements of a Special Topic Paper:\n\nAll Basic requirements\nComplete an additional section: based on the research, identify an outstanding research question – something that was not answered here. Design an experiment that can address this question using a method we have discussed in class or you have read about.\n\n\n\nSpecial Topic Presentation\nFor students who wish to demonstrate further mastery over the course materials (and earn an A in the course), a Special Topic Presentation will be required. The presentation will cover the same material as the Special Topic Paper. Students will demonstrate additional in-depth knowledge by being able to communicate their research on the special topic orally with a PowerPoint/slides presentation to their peers. They should also be expected to facilitate discussion by asking questions to their peers and also answering any questions posed during discussion."

This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by and talk to me with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns. If you are not available during my regularly scheduled office hours, please email me to schedule a different time to meet. Plus, you can earn up to two tokens by coming to see me twice during my scheduled or one-off office hours!\n\n\nAttendance\nAttending and participating in class are important parts of this course. Attendance will be taken in each class period. Participation will be assessed for each class period and students will be given multiple options for participation over the course of the semester (e.g., group discussion, pair discussion, self-reflection, in class activities, etc.). If you need to miss class for a planned activity, please let me know as far in advance as possible. If you need accommodation for a religious or cultural holiday/observance, you are encouraged to make the request as early in the semester as possible.\nIf you are dealing with an unexpected, extenuating circumstance that will keep you out of class or affect your performance for more than a day or two, reach out to the Dean of Students (dean.students@unh.edu) to request a letter be sent to all your faculty. If you are required to miss a significant class, you will be provided temporary academic supports so that you can continue to make satisfactory progress in this course. Please contact your course instructor to discuss the specific types of supports that will be implemented during your absence.\n\n\nLate work\nI would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, please let me know at least 24 hours before the due date. Specific policies for late assignments are listed for individual assignments.\n\n\nTechnical Requirements and Technical Support\nSee website listings for current recommendations and requirements related to this course. For technical assistance please call (603) 862-4242 or fill out an online support form.\n\n\nUniversity Disability Accommodations\nThe University is committed to providing students with documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you must register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS) or directly contact SAS: 227 Smith Hall or sas.office@unh.edu. Accommodation letters are created by SAS with the student. Please follow-up with me privately as soon as possible to ensure timely implementation of the identified accommodations in the letter. Faculty have an obligation to respond once they receive official notice of accommodations from SAS, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations.\n\n\nConfidentiality and Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Violence or Harassment\nThe University of New Hampshire and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students and for the university as a whole. To this end, the university requires faculty members to report to the university’s Title IX Coordinator (Bo Zaryckyj, Bo.Zaryckyj@unh.edu, 603-862-2930/1527 TTY) any incidents of sexual violence and harassment shared by students. If you wish to speak to a confidential support service provider who does not have this reporting responsibility because their discussions with clients are subject to legal privilege, you can contact SHARPP (Sexual Harassment & Rape Prevention Program) at (603) 862-7233/TTY (800) 735-2964. For more information about what happens when you report, how the university treats your information once a report is made to the Title IX Coordinator, your rights and reporting options at UNH (including anonymous reporting options) please visit student reporting options.\nHelp us improve our campus and community climate. If you have observed or experienced an incident of bias, discrimination or harassment, please report the incident by contacting the Civil Rights & Equity Office at UNH.civilrights@unh.edu or (603) 862-2930 voice/ (603) 862-1527 TTY / 7-1-1 Relay NH, or visit the CREO website. Anonymous reports may be submitted.\nLauren’s Promise. I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again. If you are in immediate danger, call 911 or UNH police ((603) 862-1427). If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call UNH’s Psychological and Counseling Services ((603) 862-2090).\n\n\nCredit Hours\nThis syllabus reflects the federal definition of a credit hour, which entails a minimum 3 hours of engaged time per week per credit over a 15-week semester. Examples of engaged time include class time, assignments, examinations, laboratories, participation in course-related experiences (attending a talk or performance, speakers and events, fieldwork, etc.), conferences, and office hours. Student work reflects intended learning outcomes and is verified through evidence of student achievement. For more information, please see this document.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nStudents are required to abide by the UNH Academic Honesty policy located in the Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities Handbook.\nPlagiarism of any type may be grounds for receiving an “F” in an assignment or an “F” in the overall course. Plagiarism is defined as “the unattributed use of the ideas, evidence, or words of another person, or the conveying the false impression that the arguments and writing in a paper are your own.” (UNH Academic Honesty Policy, 09.3) Incidents are reported to the school dean and may be grounds for further action. If you have questions about proper citation refer to your department’s writing guidelines. You can contact me at any time on this issue. Additional resources can be found through the library guides on citing sources.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nUnless otherwise specified, the use of Automated Writing Tools, including ChatGPT and similar artificial intelligence (AI) tools, is strictly prohibited in this course, even when properly attributed. The use of automated writing tools is considered plagiarism (as defined by UNH’s Academic Integrity Policy) and will be handled in accordance with the existing policy: “Use or submission of intellectual property, ideas, evidence produced by another person, including computer generated text or work outsourced to third-parties, in whole or in part as one’s own in any academic assessment without providing proper citation or attribution. In some cases, reusing one’s own previous work without acknowledging or citing the original work can constitute self-plagiarism.”\n\n\nNameCoach\nWe have a new tool in Canvas, NameCoach, that will help us all to pronounce each other’s names properly. Please join me in making our learning environment as inclusive as possible by recording your name (instructions here) and taking advantage of the opportunity to respectfully learn how to pronounce each other’s names.\n\n\nCurtailed Operations\nIf the university curtails operations due to weather, we will not hold in-person activities for our safety and the safety of others. As soon as possible, I will post an announcement on Canvas about due dates, any make-up work, and (if applicable) any online options that may make sense depending on where we are in the course. Please make sure you have access to the UNH Alert RAVE system. If needed, sign up for RAVE Alerts here.\n\n\nExpectations\nThe following guidelines will create a comfortable and productive learning environment throughout the semester.\nYou can expect me to:\n\nRespect you as individuals\nGive timely feedback\nAssign work that meets the learning objectives of the course\nAdhere to the time expectations for a 4 credit course\nGive assessments that accurately reflect the material covered in class\nProvide clear and timely expectations for course requirements\nReply to emails within 24-48 hours on weekdays\n\nI expect you to:\n\nBe attentive and engaged\nCome to class ready to participate (having done the readings)\nAdhere to the highest level of academic integrity\nSpend an adequate amount of time studying course materials each week so you can identify where you need clarification early in the learning process\nSeek help when appropriate\nCommunicate with me about challenges"

Sedivy puts both “You can learn language by watching television” and “You can’t learn language by watching television” on this list. Doing your own research online, write about the support for both claims. Do you think you can learn language by watching television? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 1.\n\n\nDue 9/12, B: Speech Perception\nCan speech perception in noisy contexts be improved through training and practice? If yes, describe what might be a useful training paradigm. If no, explain why not. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapters 4 and 7.\n\n\nDue 9/19, C: Concepts\nHow do our individual experiences and contexts shape our concepts? Can you think of any examples of how your own experiences or cultural background have influenced the way you understand certain concepts or categories? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 8.\n\n\nDue 9/26, D: Speech Production\nHow do emotions and stress impact speech production? Give at least three examples of how different emotions influence speech production. Is emotional speech easier or harder to understand than neutral speech? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 9."

Why do you think that couples would have more brain-to-brain synchrony than strangers? Do you think this would apply only to romantic couples? Why or why not? Why do you think our brains are capable of brain-to-brain synchrony? In other words, what is the advantage of having this ability? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 6 and 9.\n\n\nDue 10/5, F: Is Language Innate/Special?\nBased on the readings and your experience in class so far, do you think that language is an innate human ability? Give a few examples that argue for each side (language is innate and specific to humans vs. language is learned and is not specific to humans) and pick one at the end. Relevant readings: C&C chapters 4 and 5.\n\n\nDue 10/12, G: Language Development/Language in Machines\nChoose a few examples from the textbook of challenges that children face in language development. Open ChatGPT (requires Open AI account but is free), Bard (access through Google but is free), or Bing (requires Microsoft account but is free). Give prompts to these AI language tools that match childrens’ language challenges. Does the AI tool respond similarly to children? Give the response and explain why you think that the response matches or is different from children. Relevant readings: C&C chapter 7 and epilogue, Sedivy chapter 2.\n\n\nDue 10/17, H: Second Language Acquisition\nHow does one’s first language facilitate and hinder second language acquisition? How does second language acquisition affect one’s native language? Give at least two examples of each case (facilitate, hinder, affect). Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 12."

What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies? Give a few examples of how you might design digital reading environments to support optimal reading comprehension and learning.\n\n\nDue 11/2, J: Language and Communication Disorders\nHow does dyslexia affect abilities outside of reading? Does having dyslexia always make performance worse? Describe an example of something individuals with dyslexia are better or faster at than typical individuals and explain why this might be, linking to at least one theory of dyslexia discussed in class.\n\n\nDue 11/6, K: Language and Culture\nRead the Introduction section (pages 1-2) of the article by Bailey et al. (2022). In your own words, describe the purpose and basic methodology of the study. More generally, discuss how language shapes our perceptions of gender roles and expectations."

In your own words, describe the main questions tested in the article and what the authors found. Why do you think that labels help people learn faster? If you could change the design to this study to improve learning even more, what do you think you would do? This can involve manipulating the labels, the stimuli, or something else, but be as specific as you can. Explain why you think this would help learning.\n\n\nDue 11/21, M: Language in the Brain\nIf you think about popular media about zombies, they vary in their motor skills (some are slow, others are very fast) and sensory abilities (some can’t see, others have super hearing), but they usually don’t vary in their language skills. Zombies don’t have language. Or do they? Using what you know about language and the brain, why might zombies appear to have language deficits? Give a reasonable explanation about how zombies do not have the capacity for language and why this might be as well as how zombies may have the capacity for language, but cannot express it and why this might be. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 3.\n\n\nDue 11/28, N: Language and Music\nMusic, like language, involves a complex set of activities and mental processes. Try to generate as detailed a list as you can of the various components that go into musical and linguistic activity, going beyond those discussed in the textbook. What makes someone good at music or language? Once you’ve generated your lists, identify which of the skills that are needed for music appear to have close analogues in language. Where do you think it would be most likely that you’d see crossover in cognitive processing? Create a proposal for how you might gather evidence to support your idea of connections between music and language skills."
