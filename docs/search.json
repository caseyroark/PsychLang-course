But underneath it all, language is extraordinarily complex. In this course, through lectures, reading, writing, and discussion, we will explore some of the feats and challenges of human language including (but not limited to):\n\nComponents of language such as speech perception, speech production, reading, writing\nWhether language is a uniquely human and innate ability\nHow children develop the ability to speak and understand language\nHow language functions in the brain\nThe relationship between language and thought\nWhat happens when language does not function typically"

    "text": "Course Learning Objectives\nThe goal in this course is to teach you the skills and concepts needed to pose questions about the psychology of language in a rigorous and scientific way, to research and evaluate scientific findings related to these questions, and to critically evaluate and develop research protocols that answer these questions. In the process, you will become better able to evaluate scientific claims presented in the media and elsewhere. You will participate actively in class lectures and discussions. In addition, you will participate in exercises and laboratories designed to introduce you to how to use science to understand language. You will design a research project to gain a hands-on understanding of the psychology of language. Whether you continue in science or not, this course will benefit you in thinking critically about everyday science claims in the media and in evaluating scientific evidence for decision making. You will become a critically-thinking consumer of science, learning to detect both flaws and benefits of experimental designs and interpretations and to formulate alternate explanations. If you complete the course successfully, you will be able…\n\nto recognize, analyze, and apply principles of scientific research\nto discover what is known about a research topic\nto understand how researchers study the psychology of language and when specific techniques are most useful\nto evaluate different perspectives on fundamental questions about human language\nto formulate a question about language in a way that can be tested empirically\nto communicate research findings and your thoughts orally and in writing\nto participate in experimental research and evaluate research findings\nto employ critical thinking in evaluating scientific claims"

This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by and talk to me with whatever questions you have. This is the best and easiest way to find me and the best chance for discussing class material and concerns. If you are not available during my regularly scheduled office hours, please email me to schedule a different time to meet.\n\n\nAttendance\nAttending and participating in class are important parts of this course. Attendance will be taken in each class period. Participation will be assessed for each class period and students will be given multiple options for participation over the course of the semester (e.g., group discussion, pair discussion, self-reflection, in class activities, etc.). If you need to miss class for a planned activity, please let me know as far in advance as possible. If you need accommodation for a religious or cultural holiday/observance, you are encouraged to make the request as early in the semester as possible.\nIf you are dealing with an unexpected, extenuating circumstance that will keep you out of class or affect your performance for more than a day or two, reach out to the Dean of Students (dean.students@unh.edu) to request a letter be sent to all your faculty. If you are required to miss a significant class, you will be provided temporary academic supports so that you can continue to make satisfactory progress in this course. Please contact your course instructor to discuss the specific types of supports that will be implemented during your absence.\n\n\nLate work\nI would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something in late, please let me know at least 24 hours before the due date. Specific policies for late assignments are listed for individual assignments.\n\n\nTechnical Requirements and Technical Support\nSee website listings for current recommendations and requirements related to this course. For technical assistance please call (603) 862-4242 or fill out an online support form.\n\n\nUniversity Disability Accommodations\nThe University is committed to providing students with documented disabilities equal access to all university programs and facilities. If you think you have a disability requiring accommodations, you must register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS) or directly contact SAS: 227 Smith Hall or sas.office@unh.edu. Accommodation letters are created by SAS with the student. Please follow-up with me privately as soon as possible to ensure timely implementation of the identified accommodations in the letter. Faculty have an obligation to respond once they receive official notice of accommodations from SAS, but are under no obligation to provide retroactive accommodations.\n\n\nConfidentiality and Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Violence or Harassment\nThe University of New Hampshire and its faculty are committed to assuring a safe and productive educational environment for all students and for the university as a whole. To this end, the university requires faculty members to report to the university’s Title IX Coordinator (Bo Zaryckyj, Bo.Zaryckyj@unh.edu, 603-862-2930/1527 TTY) any incidents of sexual violence and harassment shared by students. If you wish to speak to a confidential support service provider who does not have this reporting responsibility because their discussions with clients are subject to legal privilege, you can contact SHARPP (Sexual Harassment & Rape Prevention Program) at (603) 862-7233/TTY (800) 735-2964. For more information about what happens when you report, how the university treats your information once a report is made to the Title IX Coordinator, your rights and reporting options at UNH (including anonymous reporting options) please visit student reporting options.\nHelp us improve our campus and community climate. If you have observed or experienced an incident of bias, discrimination or harassment, please report the incident by contacting the Civil Rights & Equity Office at UNH.civilrights@unh.edu or (603) 862-2930 voice/ (603) 862-1527 TTY / 7-1-1 Relay NH, or visit the CREO website. Anonymous reports may be submitted.\nLauren’s Promise. I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you. Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again. If you are in immediate danger, call 911 or UNH police ((603) 862-1427). If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call UNH’s Psychological and Counseling Services ((603) 862-2090).\n\n\nCredit Hours\nThis syllabus reflects the federal definition of a credit hour, which entails a minimum 3 hours of engaged time per week per credit over a 15-week semester. Examples of engaged time include class time, assignments, examinations, laboratories, participation in course-related experiences (attending a talk or performance, speakers and events, fieldwork, etc.), conferences, and office hours. Student work reflects intended learning outcomes and is verified through evidence of student achievement. For more information, please see this document.\n\n\nAcademic Honesty\nStudents are required to abide by the UNH Academic Honesty policy located in the Student Rights, Rules, and Responsibilities Handbook.\nPlagiarism of any type may be grounds for receiving an “F” in an assignment or an “F” in the overall course. Plagiarism is defined as “the unattributed use of the ideas, evidence, or words of another person, or the conveying the false impression that the arguments and writing in a paper are your own.” (UNH Academic Honesty Policy, 09.3) Incidents are reported to the school dean and may be grounds for further action. If you have questions about proper citation refer to your department’s writing guidelines. You can contact me at any time on this issue. Additional resources can be found through the library guides on citing sources.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nUnless otherwise specified, the use of Automated Writing Tools, including ChatGPT and similar artificial intelligence (AI) tools, is strictly prohibited in this course, even when properly attributed. The use of automated writing tools is considered plagiarism (as defined by UNH’s Academic Integrity Policy) and will be handled in accordance with the existing policy: “Use or submission of intellectual property, ideas, evidence produced by another person, including computer generated text or work outsourced to third-parties, in whole or in part as one’s own in any academic assessment without providing proper citation or attribution. In some cases, reusing one’s own previous work without acknowledging or citing the original work can constitute self-plagiarism.”\n\n\nNameCoach\nWe have a new tool in Canvas, NameCoach, that will help us all to pronounce each other’s names properly. Please join me in making our learning environment as inclusive as possible by recording your name (instructions here) and taking advantage of the opportunity to respectfully learn how to pronounce each other’s names.\n\n\nCurtailed Operations\nIf the university curtails operations due to weather, we will not hold in-person activities for our safety and the safety of others. As soon as possible, I will post an announcement on Canvas about due dates, any make-up work, and (if applicable) any online options that may make sense depending on where we are in the course. Please make sure you have access to the UNH Alert RAVE system. If needed, sign up for RAVE Alerts here.\n\n\nExpectations\nThe following guidelines will create a comfortable and productive learning environment throughout the semester.\nYou can expect me to:\n\nRespect you as individuals\nGive timely feedback\nAssign work that meets the learning objectives of the course\nAdhere to the time expectations for a 4 credit course\nGive assessments that accurately reflect the material covered in class\nProvide clear and timely expectations for course requirements\nReply to emails within 24-48 hours on weekdays\n\nI expect you to:\n\nBe attentive and engaged\nCome to class ready to participate (having done the readings)\nAdhere to the highest level of academic integrity\nSpend an adequate amount of time studying course materials each week so you can identify where you need clarification early in the learning process\nSeek help when appropriate\nCommunicate with me about challenges"

Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 6 and 9.\n\n\nDue 10/5, F: Is Language Innate/Special?\nBased on the readings and your experience in class so far, do you think that language is an innate human ability? Give a few examples that argue for each side (language is innate and specific to humans vs. language is learned and is not specific to humans) and pick one at the end. Relevant readings: C&C chapters 4 and 5.\n\n\nDue 10/12, G: Language Development/Language in Machines\nChoose a few examples from the textbook of challenges that children face in language development. Open ChatGPT (requires Open AI account but is free), Bard (access through Google but is free), or Bing (requires Microsoft account but is free). Give prompts to these AI language tools that match childrens’ language challenges. Does the AI tool respond similarly to children? Give the response and explain why you think that the response matches or is different from children. Relevant readings: C&C chapter 7 and epilogue, Sedivy chapter 2.\n\n\nDue 10/17, H: Second Language Acquisition\nHow does one’s first language facilitate and hinder second language acquisition? How does second language acquisition affect one’s native language? Give at least two examples of each case (facilitate, hinder, affect). Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 12."

What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of these technologies? Give a few examples of how you might design digital reading environments to support optimal reading comprehension and learning.\n\n\nDue 11/2, J: Language and Communication Disorders\nHow does dyslexia affect abilities outside of reading? Does having dyslexia always make performance worse? Describe an example of something individuals with dyslexia are better or faster at than typical individuals and explain why this might be, linking to at least one theory of dyslexia discussed in class.\n\n\nDue 11/6, K: Language and Culture\nRead the Introduction section (pages 1-2) of the article by Bailey et al. (2022). In your own words, describe the purpose and basic methodology of the study. More generally, discuss how language shapes our perceptions of gender roles and expectations."

In your own words, describe the main questions tested in the article and what the authors found. Why do you think that labels help people learn faster? If you could change the design to this study to improve learning even more, what do you think you would do? This can involve manipulating the labels, the stimuli, or something else, but be as specific as you can. Explain why you think this would help learning.\n\n\nDue 11/21, M: Language in the Brain\nIf you think about popular media about zombies, they vary in their motor skills (some are slow, others are very fast) and sensory abilities (some can’t see, others have super hearing), but they usually don’t vary in their language skills. Zombies don’t have language. Or do they? Using what you know about language and the brain, why might zombies appear to have language deficits? Give a reasonable explanation about how zombies do not have the capacity for language and why this might be as well as how zombies may have the capacity for language, but cannot express it and why this might be. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 3.\n\n\nDue 11/28, N: Language and Music\nMusic, like language, involves a complex set of activities and mental processes. Try to generate as detailed a list as you can of the various components that go into musical and linguistic activity, going beyond those discussed in the textbook. What makes someone good at music or language? Once you’ve generated your lists, identify which of the skills that are needed for music appear to have close analogues in language. Where do you think it would be most likely that you’d see crossover in cognitive processing? Create a proposal for how you might gather evidence to support your idea of connections between music and language skills."
