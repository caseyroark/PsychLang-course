<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="course-overview">Course Overview</h2>
<p>Psychology of Language explores the cognitive and neural bases of human language. We use language in our everyday lives mostly effortlessly and without thinking. But underneath it all, language is extraordinarily complex. In this course, through lectures, reading, writing, and discussion, we will explore some of the feats and challenges of human language including (but not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li>Components of language such as speech perception, speech production, reading, writing</li>
<li>Whether language is a uniquely human and innate ability</li>
<li>How children develop the ability to speak and understand language</li>
<li>How language functions in the brain</li>
<li>The relationship between language and thought</li>
<li>What happens when language does not function typically</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="course-learning-objectives">Course Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>The overarching goal of this course is to teach you the skills and concepts that you need to critically evaluate scientific findings about the psychology of language. One of my goals is for you to take ownership over your own learning in this course to achieve the outcomes that you desire. My course is designed differently than most classes you’ve probably taken. The grade you achieve in this course is based on the learning objectives that you achieve and how deeply you demonstrate knowledge or mastery of the topics. More on this will follow below, but some of the possible course learning objectives are to . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Assess claims made in research articles and evaluate whether the data support or refute theories about the psychology of language</li>
<li>Assess and evaluate the usefulness of different behavioral and neuroscientific methodologies to answer specific research questions</li>
<li>Formulate a question about language that can be tested empirically</li>
<li>Design an experiment that can address a specific research question about language</li>
<li>Synthesize research findings from multiple empirical sources</li>
<li>Communicate synthesized research findings in writing</li>
<li>Communicate synthesized research findings orally</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="course-structure" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="course-structure">Course Structure</h2>
<p><a href="https://mycourses.unh.edu/courses">myCourses/Canvas</a> is the learning management tool we use for this course. The course is organized by class meetings. You will be able to find external readings and submit assignments. Please do not message me through myCourses – email me instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="grades" class="level2 unnumbered">
<h2 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="grades">Grades</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, grading and assessment of your learning in this course will function differently from what you have probably encountered in your other courses. Importantly, my decisions about how grades and learning assessments will happen in this class is based on the science of learning - that is, what we know about how to actually learn and engage in the material. Because this looks different from most of what you’ve probably experienced before, we will spend substantial time going over what this looks like at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>The grade you receive in this course is completely up to you. Your final grade will depend on class attendance (which is critical in this course) and completion of specific assessments of learning to a satisfactory standard. The assessments in this course are organized into modules. Achieving certain letter grades requires satisfactory completion of the different modules.</p>
<p><strong>To earn an A in this course, all of the following are required:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>What do ‘satisfactory’ and ‘unsatisfactory’ mean?</strong></p>
<p>My goal is for you to reach your desired learning objectives (and to get the grade you hope to achieve in this class). As a result, I need to assess whether you met a learning objective or you did not meet the learning objective. Each assignment must be completed to satisfactory standards to be counted as complete. Unsatisfactory is the same as incomplete. There is no partial credit – an assignment either meets the standards or does not.</p>
<p>The requirements for a satisfactory standard will be made clear for each assignment. Examples of both satisfactory and unsatisfactory responses will be given for many assignments. If you ever are unsure of what an assignment demands for satisfactory standard, please reach out to me. Assignments will have the possibility of resubmission (sometimes without a cost, other times with a cost - we will get into that in a sec) so that you can meet the satisfactory standards.</p>
<p>It’s also critical for a satisfactory standard that you turn in assignments on time. Late work may be accepted - but it will cost you (see below).</p>
<p><strong>Flexibility and tokens:</strong></p>
<p>There is built-in flexibility across the course. For the Foundational and Basic Modules, you may resubmit the assignments at no cost (unlimited times for Foundational, up to two times for Basic). For resubmissions beyond this, we will use a token system.</p>
<p>You will be given four (virtual) tokens at the beginning of the semester.</p>
<p>You may earn additional tokens in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn in any Research Report at least 24 hours before the stated deadline (max 5 tokens)</li>
<li>turn in the Special Topic Paper at least 24 hours before the stated deadline (1 token)</li>
<li>visit my office hours (1 token per visit, max 2 tokens)</li>
<li>attend the class immediately before Spring Break (3/14/24; 1 token)</li>
<li>attend the last day of class (5/2/24; 1 token)</li>
</ul>
<p>You may spend tokens in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>an additional resubmission attempt on any assignment (i.e., beyond two for Basic Module or any resubmission for A or B level)</li>
<li>remove an unexcused absence from your total number of absences</li>
<li>turn in an assignment up to 24 hours late (if you wanted to turn in an assignment 25 hours late, you’d need 2 tokens)</li>
<li>drop your lowest quiz score (only once)</li>
<li>If you have additional tokens at the end of the semester that you do not want to or cannot use on resubmissions, absences, or late assignments, you may spend two or three tokens to skip a question of your choice on the final exam (two tokens for short answer and drawing type questions, three tokens for essay questions). This can accumulate. If you have, let’s say, four tokens at the end of the semester, you may skip two short answer questions on the final exam. I’ll make sure you know how many tokens you have going into the final exam so you can indicate which questions you’d like to skip if relevant.</li>
<li>Finally, if you have four tokens left at the end of the semester, I’ll increase your grade from a B, C, or D to a B+, C+, or D+. For example, say you go into the final with six tokens. You spend two tokens to skip two questions that you’d prefer not to answer. You end the course having earned a B. With those four leftover tokens, your grade will be increased to a B+. Note that it might make more sense for you to use tokens to account for absences or to resubmit an assignment. You will not be able to use tokens to get bumped up beyond the letter grade you earned (e.g., if you earned a B, you cannot be bumped up to an A- if you have not completed the requirements for an A). Intermediate minus distinctions will not be given unless under bizarre unforeseen circumstances. If you earned a specific letter grade, you’ve earned the full letter grade (e.g., A, B, C, D).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Unexcused versus excused absences:</strong></p>
<p>An unexcused absence is any absence that does not have a clear, documented, and reasonable reason for missing class. You may spend one of your tokens to nullify an unexcused absence.</p>
<p>If you must miss class for a clear, documented, and reasonable reason (e.g., sickness, medical reason, emergency, etc.), you do not need to spend one of your tokens. You must communicate with me as soon as possible with documentation, if applicable.</p>
<p>If you need to miss class for a planned activity, please let me know as far in advance as possible. If you need accommodation for a religious or cultural holiday/observance, you are encouraged to make the request as early in the semester as possible.</p>

<h3 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="assignment-types">Assignment Types:</h3>
<section id="reading-questions" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="reading-questions">Reading Questions</h4>
<p>For most classes (20/28 classes) there will be an assigned reading. There will be research questions associated with each reading that you should reflect on, answer, and identify concepts you are still struggling with or have questions about.</p>
<p>The reading questions are meant to give you additional examples, guidance, or ways to think about the material you are encountering. It is not meant to demonstrate the only parts of the chapter you should read or pay attention to. You may be quizzed or asked about things that are in the reading, but are not addressed in the reading questions. You are responsible for all material in the reading.</p>
</section>
<section id="homework" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="homework">Homework</h4>
<p>There are several homework assignments that are due throughout the semester. Some of these are foundational for further progress in the course and are thus a part of the Foundational Module. Some of these are basic aspects that I would expect to be mastered for general C-level passing of this course and are part of the Basic Module. Others are more advanced and get into demonstration of deeper conceptual knowledge on psychology of language and are in Modules A and B.</p>
<p>Each assignment has its own description, which can be accessed through the course website. Take note of the specific assignments required for the completion of specific modules above.</p>
<p>Most homework will align with readings and the topics that are being covered in class at that time.</p>
</section>
<section id="quizzes-and-learning-assessments" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="quizzes-and-learning-assessments">Quizzes and learning assessments</h4>
<p>There will be five quizzes associated with the first part of this course. Quizzes are designed to make sure that you are engaging with and understanding the material and will cover both readings and lectures. Quizzes will be associated with each specific topic and will not be cumulative. Quizzes will be administered in person at the end of each topic and will have multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blanks, true/false, and identification question formats.</p>
<p>Pre-quiz learning assessments. Before each quiz, you will complete a pre-quiz learning assessment. You will rate your confidence about certain topics and identify concepts you still have questions about. We will address these ongoing questions in class on the day before each quiz.</p>
<p>Post-quiz learning assessments. After each quiz, you will complete a post-quiz learning assessment. For each question you were incorrect, you should reflect on your thinking – why did you make the response that you did? What was incorrect about this response and what is the correct response? How will you change your behavior for the next quiz?</p>
</section>
<section id="final-exam" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="final-exam">Final Exam</h4>
<p>There is a cumulative written final exam for this course. This exam will assess your knowledge acquired from topics spanning across the course. The exam grades will not be curved, but please note the relatively flexible scores to demonstrate mastery over the material (e.g., A &gt;= 80% on final exam; B &gt;=70% on final exam; C/D: &gt;= 60% on final exam; F: &lt;60% on final exam) in addition to the other module-based assignments in the course.</p>
<p>The final exam will occur in person on a date determined by the university’s schedule – this is not negotiable.</p>
<p>As stated above, you may trade in tokens to skip questions on the final, with no limit on the number of tokens (2 tokens, 1 short answer or drawing question; 3 tokens, 1 essay question). Note that you may have a possible maximum of 14 tokens. There will be 10 questions on the final, so you will still need take the final, but this will simplify it greatly if you are able to/choose to save your tokens.</p>
</section>
<section id="research-reports" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="research-reports">Research Reports</h4>
<p>Five times in the semester, Research Reports will be due. Research Reports require you to read a specific brief research article, answer some basic questions about the experimental design (e.g., dependent/independent variables, measures, hypotheses), summarize the methods and results in your own words, and reflect on the meaning of the research outcomes based on what you’ve learned in the class and your real-world experiences.</p>
</section>
<section id="special-topic-paper" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="special-topic-paper">Special Topic Paper</h4>
<p>For students who wish to demonstrate further mastery over the course materials (and earn an A or B in the course), a Special Topic Paper will be required. This topic will be one of the advanced special topics covered in the second half of the course. This paper will require thinking deeply about how research in this topic area relates to concepts we have discussed in class.</p>
<p>Basic requirements of a Special Topic Paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selection of special topic (with my approval)</li>
<li>Read article assigned for special topic</li>
<li>Submitted on time – due by the beginning of class on the day of the special topic discussion</li>
<li>Fulfill specific requirements of special topic paper (defined specifically in that assignment)</li>
</ul>
<p>“A” requirements of a Special Topic Paper:</p>
<ul>
<li>All Basic requirements</li>
<li>Complete an additional section: based on the research, identify an outstanding research question – something that was not answered here. Design an experiment that can address this question using a method we have discussed in class or you have read about.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="special-topic-presentation" class="level4 unnumbered">
<h4 class="unnumbered anchored" data-anchor-id="special-topic-presentation">Special Topic Presentation</h4>
<p>For students who wish to demonstrate further mastery over the course materials (and earn an A in the course), a Special Topic Presentation will be required. The presentation will cover the same material as the Special Topic Paper. Students will demonstrate additional in-depth knowledge by being able to communicate their research on the special topic orally with a PowerPoint/slides presentation to their peers. They should also be expected to facilitate discussion by asking questions to their peers and also answering any questions posed during discussion.</p>
