But underneath it all, language is extraordinarily complex. In this course, through lectures, reading, writing, and discussion, we will explore some of the feats and challenges of human language including (but not limited to):\n\nComponents of language such as speech perception, speech production, reading, writing\nWhether language is a uniquely human and innate ability\nHow children develop the ability to speak and understand language\nHow language functions in the brain\nThe relationship between language and thought\nWhat happens when language does not function typically"

Sedivy puts both “You can learn language by watching television” and “You can’t learn language by watching television” on this list. Doing your own research online, write about the support for both claims. Do you think you can learn language by watching television? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 1.\n\n\nDue 9/12, B: speech perception\nCan speech perception be improved through training and practice? If yes, describe what might be a useful training paradigm. If no, explain why not. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapters 4 and 7.\n\n\nDue 9/19, C: concepts/speech production\nHow do emotions and stress impact speech production? Give at least three examples of how different emotions influence speech production. Is emotional speech easier or harder to understand than neutral speech? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapters 5 and 10.\n\n\nDue 9/26, D: concepts\nHow do our individual experiences and contexts shape our concepts?

Why do you think that couples would have more brain-to-brain synchrony than strangers? Do you think this would apply only to romantic couples? Why or why not? Why do you think our brains are capable of brain-to-brain synchrony? In other words, what is the advantage of having this ability? Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 6 and 9.\n\n\nDue 10/10, F: Is language innate/special?\nBased on the readings and your experience in class so far, do you think that language is an innate human ability? Give a few examples that argue for each side (language is innate and specific to humans vs. language is learned and is not specific to humans) and pick one at the end. Relevant readings: C&C chapters 4 and 5.\n\n\nDue 10/17, G: Language development/language in machines\nChoose a few examples from the textbook of challenges that children face in language development. Open ChatGPT (requires Open AI account but is free), Bard (access through Google but is free), or Bing (requires Microsoft account but is free). Give prompts to these AI language tools that match childrens’ language challenges. Does the AI tool respond similarly to children? Give the response and explain why you think that the response matches or is different from children.

In your own words, describe the main questions tested in the article and what the authors found. Why do you think that labels help people learn faster? If you could change the design to this study to improve learning even more, what do you think you would do? This can involve manipulating the labels, the stimuli, or something else, but be as specific as you can. Explain why you think this would help learning.\n\n\nDue 11/28, M: Language in the brain\nIf you think about popular media about zombies, they vary in their motor skills (some are slow, others are very fast) and sensory abilities (some can’t see, others have super hearing), but they usually don’t vary in their language skills. Zombies don’t have language. Or do they? Using what you know about language and the brain, why might zombies appear to have language deficits? Give a reasonable explanation about how zombies do not have the capacity for language and why this might be as well as how zombies may have the capacity for language, but cannot express it and why this might be. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 3.\n\n\nDue 12/5, N: Language in the brain\nMusic, like language, involves a complex set of activities and mental processes. Try to generate as detailed a list as you can of the various components that go into musical and linguistic activity, going beyond those discussed in the textbook. What makes someone good at music or language? Once you’ve generated your lists, identify which of the skills that are needed for music appear to have close analogues in language. Where do you think it would be most likely that you’d see crossover in cognitive processing? Create a proposal for how you might gather evidence to support your idea of connections between music and language skills. Relevant readings: Sedivy chapter 3."
