## Course Overview {-}

Psychology of Language explores the cognitive and neural bases of human
language. We use language in our everyday lives mostly effortlessly and
without thinking. But underneath it all, language is extraordinarily
complex. In this course, through lectures, reading, writing, and
discussion, we will explore some of the feats and challenges of human
language including (but not limited to): 

- Components of language such as speech perception, speech production, reading, writing 
- Whether language is a uniquely human and innate ability 
- How children develop the ability to speak and understand language 
- How language functions in the brain 
- The relationship between language and thought 
- What happens when language does not function typically

## Course Description {-}

Theories of language structure, functions of human language, meaning,
relationship of language to other mental processes, language
acquisition, indices of language development, speech perception,
reading.

## Course Learning Objectives {-}

The goal in this course is to teach you the skills and concepts needed to pose questions about the psychology of language in a rigorous and scientific way, to research and evaluate scientific findings related to these questions, and to critically evaluate and develop research protocols that answer these questions. In the process, you will become better able to evaluate scientific claims presented in the media and elsewhere. You will participate actively in class lectures and discussions. In addition, you will participate in exercises and laboratories designed to introduce you to how to use science to understand language. You will design a research project to gain a hands-on understanding of the psychology of language. Whether you continue in science or not, this course will benefit you in thinking critically about everyday science claims in the media and in evaluating scientific evidence for decision making. You will become a critically-thinking consumer of science, learning to detect both flaws and benefits of experimental designs and interpretations and to formulate alternate explanations. If you complete the course successfully, you will be able...

- to recognize, analyze, and apply principles of scientific research
- to discover what is known about a research topic
- to understand how researchers study the psychology of language and when specific techniques are most useful
- to evaluate different perspectives on fundamental questions about human language
- to formulate a question about language in a way that can be tested empirically
- to communicate research findings and your thoughts orally and in writing
- to participate in experimental research and evaluate research findings 
- to employ critical thinking in evaluating scientific claims

I expect you to: 
- Be attentive and engaged

### General well-being and stress

Do your best to follow guidelines to keep physically healthy. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful. It is courageous to reach out for help.

If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. [Psychological and Counseling Services (PACS)](https://www.unh.edu/pacs/) is here to help, (603) 862-2090. Consider reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help. Your instructor can point you to resources.

If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call someone immediately, day or night you can contact Rapid Response Access Point at 833-710-6477 or visit NH988.com. If the situation is life threatening, call the police. (UNH Police: (603) 862-1427; Off campus: 911).

If you or someone you know is experiencing food insecurity -- worry about affording food -- there are campus resources to help. Fill out a [Swipe it Forward request form](https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofNH&layout_id=15) or visit the Cats' Cupboard in the MUB 140A. See this [website](https://www.unh.edu/dean-of-students/getting-help/housing-food-financial-basic-needs-support) for more Basic Needs Support and Resources. 

### [Lauren's Promise](https://laurenmccluskey.org/laurens-promise/) 

I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.

Lauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, [was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2019/02/10/commentary-failing-lauren/). We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.

If you are in immediate danger, call 911 or UNH police ((603) 862-1427).

If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me and I will connect you to resources or call UNH’s Psychological and Counseling Services ((603) 862-2090).
