## Course Overview {-}

Psychology of Language explores the cognitive and neural bases of human
language. We use language in our everyday lives mostly effortlessly and
without thinking. But underneath it all, language is extraordinarily
complex. In this course, through lectures, reading, writing, and
discussion, we will explore some of the feats and challenges of human
language including (but not limited to): 

- Components of language such as speech perception, speech production, reading, writing 
- Whether language is a uniquely human and innate ability 
- How children develop the ability to speak and understand language 
- How language functions in the brain 
- The relationship between language and thought 
- What happens when language does not function typically
